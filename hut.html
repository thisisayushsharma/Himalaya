            HEY! Welcome to my Little hut. I will let you shelther and even give you 10 weapons if you help me open 
            this letter. This letter was sent by my brother and few days after he sent it he died. I believe the message
            in this letter will help me figure out why and how did he die. My brother did read a lot about the special code that 
            Germans read during the second World War.
