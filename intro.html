            Hello Traveller! Here you can see the Map of the Himalayan Range you are planning to go to. You are at
            Pothana right now. I would suggest you to go till Low Camp and sleep there today as the wild animals 
            can be dangerous. It's all dense forest till Low Camp. Take this 5 golds and 2 weapons. I would suggest you
            go the shop right now to add more weapons since you might need more than 2 weapons if you were to encounter a 
            Cheetah or something. Have a Safe Journey to the top Traveller.
        </p>

            Hey I forgot to tell you about YETI. In the map I have marked the place where people say they have seen the 
            footprints of YETI. So be careful. Okay enough talking from me now. See you once you get back.
        </p>
